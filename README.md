# Investment-Portfolio-Risk-Return-Analysis
UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 4 Module 4 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I evaluated four new investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios by determining the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

I created a Jupyter notebook that contains my data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics, code for data collection from CSV data, preparation of datasets for analysis by cleaningmissing/erroneous data, and analysis through summary and visualizations toselect time periods for arbitrage opportunities.

## Technologies

This project uses Python programming language, Jupyter notebook, the libraries and functions associated, etc.

## Installation Guide

Make sure to install Jupyter notebook (comes with Anaconda)

## Usage

The jupyter file containts: 
- A single DataFrame imported from a CSV file that has a DateTimeIndex.

- A risk analysis of the assets that the DataFrame contains vs. the S&P 500. This analysis should include risk-return metrics, including the daily returns, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and beta.

- An evaluation of each asset that uses rolling statistics to track the risk-reward behavior over time.

My quantitative analysis contains: 
- Performance

- Volatility

- Risk

- Risk-return profile

- Portfolio diversification

General information about my analysis:
